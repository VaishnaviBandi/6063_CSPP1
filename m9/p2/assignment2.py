Exercise: Assignment-2
Next, implement the function getGuessedWord that takes in two parameters
a string, secret_word, and a list of letters, letters_guessed. This function
returns a string that is comprised of letters and underscores, based on what
letters in letters_guessed are in secret_word. This shouldn't be too different from isWordGuessed!

def get_guessed_word(secret_word, letters_guessed):
    '''
    secret_word: string, the word the user is guessing
    letters_guessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
    returns: string, comprised of letters and underscores that represents
      what letters in secret_word have been guessed so far.

    str_ing = ""
    for i in secret_word:
        if i not in letters_guessed:
            str_ing = str_ing + "_"
        else:
            str_ing = str_ing + i
